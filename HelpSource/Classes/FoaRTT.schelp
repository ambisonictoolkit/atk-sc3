DESCRIPTION::
Rotate a First Order Ambisonic signal (B-format) around the z, x and y axes.


The inbuilt equivalent is link::Classes/Rotate2::.



NOTE::
link::Classes/FoaRTT:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: in
The B-format signal, an array: [w, x, y, z]

argument:: rotAngle
Rotation angle around z-axis, in radians.

argument:: tilAngle
Rotation angle around x-axis, in radians.

argument:: tumAngle
Rotation angle around y-axis, in radians.


argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.
