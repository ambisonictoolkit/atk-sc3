//---------------------------------------------------------------------
//	The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) is a soundfield kernel support library.
//
// 	Class: AtkTests
//
//	The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) is intended to bring together a number of tools and
//	methods for working with Ambisonic surround sound. The intention is for the toolset
//	to be both ergonomic and comprehensive, providing both classic and novel algorithms
//	to creatively manipulate and synthesise complex Ambisonic soundfields.
//
//	The tools are framed for the user to think in terms of the soundfield kernel. By
//	this, it is meant the ATK addresses the holistic problem of creatively controlling a
//	complete soundfield, allowing and encouraging the composer to think beyond the placement
//	of sounds in a sound-space and instead attend to the impression and image of a soundfield.
//	This approach takes advantage of the model the Ambisonic technology presents, and is
//	viewed to be the idiomatic mode for working with the Ambisonic technique.
//
//	We hope you enjoy the ATK!
