categories:: Libraries>Ambisonic Toolkit>UGens>FOA>Transformer, UGens>Multichannel>Ambisonics
related:: Classes/FoaProximity, Classes/FoaTransform, Classes/FoaDecode

DESCRIPTION::
Apply near-field compensation filtering to a First Order Ambisonic signal (B-format).

note::
link::Classes/FoaNFC:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.
::



CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: in
The B-format signal, an array: [w, x, y, z]

argument:: distance
The distance, in meters.

warning:: strong::Distance:: = 0 is an invalid value! ::

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.


discussion::

link::Classes/FoaNFC:: facilitates the reduction or removal of the link::http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_(audio)##proximity effect:: from encoded signals. The link::http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_(audio)##proximity effect:: can be an important contributor to perceptions of nearness.

Near-field compensation footnote::Usually called distance compensation in the classic Ambisonics literature.:: is usually used in conjunction with link::Classes/FoaDecode:: to compensate for the distance of loudspeakers on playback. Additionally, link::Classes/FoaNFC:: can also be used to reduce the link::http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_(audio)##proximity effect:: found in near-field recordings.


The Ambisonic Toolkit's proximity filter, link::Classes/FoaProximity::, undoes link::Classes/FoaNFC:: given the same strong::distance:: argument.
