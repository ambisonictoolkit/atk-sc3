SUBSECTION:: Directivity

METHOD:: newDirectO
Adjust the soundfield directivity (across the origin).

argument:: angle
The distortion angle, in radians. 0 to pi/2

discussion::

strong::Angle:: = 0 retains the current directivity of the soundfield. Increasing strong::angle:: towards pi/2 decreases the directivity, reducing the gains on the directional compenents to zero, and is equivalent to a spatial low-pass filter. The resulting image becomes omnidirectional or directionless.
