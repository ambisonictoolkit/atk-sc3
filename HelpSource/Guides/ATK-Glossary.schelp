## A-format
keyword:: format
|| Component or signal set in the emphasis::angular domain::, evenly distributed across the surface of the sphere in a emphasis::spherical design::. Within the context of the Ambisonic Toolkit, any required equalisation or radial filtering is expected to have been applied. In other words, the Ambisonic Toolkit views emphasis::A-format:: as a uniform spherical decomposition of the soundfield.

In conjunction with emphasis::Associated Legendre:: degrees references individual emphasis::spherical harmonic:: components, in the form (ℓ, m). emphasis::Associated Legendre:: indices range |m| <= ℓ for a complete coefficient set of a given degrees.
