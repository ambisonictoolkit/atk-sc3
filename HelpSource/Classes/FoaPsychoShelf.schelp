DESCRIPTION::
Apply psychoacoustic shelf filtering to a First Order Ambisonic signal (B-format).

note::
link::Classes/FoaPsychoShelf:: is usually called internally by link::Classes/FoaDecode::.
::


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: in
The B-format signal, an array: [w, x, y, z]

argument:: freq
Shelf filter corner frequency, in Hz.

argument:: k0
High frequency scale for 0-order harmonic: W.

argument:: k1
High frequency scale for 1st-order harmonics: X, Y, Z.

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.


discussion::

link::Classes/FoaPsychoShelf:: is invoked by link::Classes/FoaDecode:: when a dual-band psychoacoustically optimised decoder footnote::See: E. Benjamin, R. Lee, and A. Heller, "Is My Decoder Ambisonic?," in Proceedings of the 125th Audio Engineering Society Convention, San Francisco, 2008.:: is called by setting strong::k:: to code:: 'dual' ::. This kind of decoder is the optimum choice for small scale studio or domestic settings.

note:: In normal circumstances, the user will not call link::Classes/FoaPsychoShelf:: directly.::
