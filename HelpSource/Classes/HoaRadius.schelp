subsection:: Radius

code::
// --------------------------------------
// find effective radius with respect to freq & order
~effFreq = 1000;  // duplex theory of hearing
~effFreq = 700;  // approx center of hearing

~order = 5;
~order = 3;
~order = 1;

~hoaRadius = HoaRadius.newFreq(~effFreq, ~order);

~effRadius = ~hoaRadius.radius;
~effDiameter = 2 * ~effRadius;

subsection:: Order

code::
// --------------------------------------
// find effective order with respect to radius & freq
~hoaRadius = HoaRadius.new(1.5);  // @ refRadius
~hoaRadius = HoaRadius.new(0.5);  // 4 peeps

~hoaRadius = HoaRadius.new(0.18 / 2);  // head (or 0.215)
~hoaRadius.radius

~effFreq = 1000;  // duplex theory of hearing
