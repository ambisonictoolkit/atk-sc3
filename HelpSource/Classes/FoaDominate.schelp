DESCRIPTION::
Apply dominance to a First Order Ambisonic signal (B-format) along an arbitrary axis.


NOTE::
link::Classes/FoaDominate:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: in
The B-format signal, an array: [w, x, y, z]

argument:: gain
Dominance gain, in dB.

argument:: theta
Azimuth, in radians.

argument:: phi
Elevation, in radians.

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.


discussion:: Applies dominance along the axis defined by strong::theta:: and strong::phi::. See link::Classes/FoaDominateX::.
